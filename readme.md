# FP-growth Algorithm

Codes mainly come from "Machine Learning in Action", please refer to the book if you're interested in.

A bug is found and fixed in `createFPtree` function, i.e., the sorting part.

FP-growth functions are in `fpgrowth.py`.

Two examples using FP-growth to discover frequent sets are provided in `main.py`.
